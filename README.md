# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is my first project on my journey to learn to code. I built this project to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Students should be able to store notes in this webpage and use it to assist their studying. 

In this project, I made my first index.html and wrote my first HTML code. Afterwards, I made style.css, wrote my first CSS code, and linked the file to index.html. Lastly, I made script.js and linked that as well. Throughout the projects I was also learning Gitflow. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the Chrome DevTools console by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser, and we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
