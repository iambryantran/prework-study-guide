          <li>GitHub allows multiple devs to work on a single project at the same time, reduces the risk of duplicative or conflicting work, and can help decrease production time. Developers can build code, track changes, and innovate solutions to problems that might arise during the site development process simultaneously.</li>
          <li>Repository (Repo): A folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
          <li>Branch: A copy of your repo.</li>
          <li>Main/Master Branch: This is the "live" version of your code.</li>
          <li>Development Branch: This is the working version of your code. This branch may consist of multiple feature branches.</li>
          <li>Feature Branch: This is a working branch for one feature.</li>
          <li>Issue: Allow users to report new tasks, content fixes, and to track progress on a project board from beginning to end of a specific project.</li>
          <li>Commit: These are confirmed changes to your code. Commits should be one related change.</li>
          <li>Pull Request: A request for your pushed commits to be reviewed and merged.</li>
