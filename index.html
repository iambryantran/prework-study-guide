        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to structure a language. It is made of elements that work together to provide content and a framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>Element: A type of content on a page.</li>
          <li>Elements also divide the content on the page and can describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
          <li>HTML Elements usually contain tags, opening and closing brackets, “<>”. Within the tags can be content or even other nested elements.</li>
          <li>DOCTYPE html tells the browser to expect an HTML document.</li>
          <li>html lang="en" this specifies English. The lang= part is an attribute.</li>
          <li>meta charset="UTF-8" sets the character set to UTF-8.</li>
          <li>ul is an unordered list that uses bullet points.</li>
          <li>ol is an ordered list that will use numbers.</li>
          <li>li is a list item.</li>
          <li>Semantic elements are named after what they do.</li>
          <li>link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" is used in the head to link to our CSS stylesheet.</li>
          <li>script src="./assets/script.js" is used at the end of the body to link to our JS script.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>External CSS is typically preferred due to flexibility.  It allows you to keep your CSS rules separate from your HTML file.</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model: In CSS everything is a box.</li>
          <li>Class: This attribute allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Selector(s) define the element or attribute in which the rules will apply. These can be things like * (all visible elements), div, elements, or classes.</li>
          <li>Declaration blocks are the rules that you want to apply to the selector. These are contained within curly brackets.</li>
          <li>Properties are the attributes of the selector that you want to change. These can be things like color, font-size, or background-color.</li>
          <li>Values are the values of the properties. These can be things like red, 16px, or #000000.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Block is a value that assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>CSS Structure: selector1, selector2 {property: value;}</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub allows multiple devs to work on a single project at the same time, reduces the risk of duplicative or conflicting work, and can help decrease production time. Developers can build code, track changes, and innovate solutions to problems that might arise during the site development process simultaneously.</li>
          <li>Repository (Repo): A folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
          <li>Branch: A copy of your repo.</li>
          <li>Main/Master Branch: This is the "live" version of your code.</li>
          <li>Development Branch: This is the working version of your code. This branch may consist of multiple feature branches.</li>
          <li>Feature Branch: This is a working branch for one feature.</li>
          <li>Issue: Allow users to report new tasks, content fixes, and to track progress on a project board from beginning to end of a specific project.</li>
          <li>Commit: These are confirmed changes to your code. Commits should be one related change.</li>
          <li>Pull Request: A request for your pushed commits to be reviewed and merged.</li>
          <li>Do not forget to "git pull" after a merge to update locally!</li>
          <li>git clone [URL]: clones a repo from GitHub</li>
          <li>git remote -v: confirm fetch and push connection to repo</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add file-name: adds file (or -A for all) to your staging area</li>
          <li>git reset file-name: removes a file from your staging area</li>
          <li>git commit -m "description": essentially takes a snapshot of your staging area</li>
          <li>git pull origin branch-name: pulls in the target branch to make sure you are up to date</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: sends my snapshot to the GitHub repo</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JS is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is what turns a static HTML/CSS webpage interactive.</li>
          <li>Boolean statements are true/false statements. All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Conditional Statements and Loops: Controls if and when code is executed.</li>
          <li>= is used to assign a variable.</li>
          <li>== is used to compare two values.</li>
          <li>=== is used to compare two values and their data types.</li>
          <li>=== is preferred over == so you don't run into accidental conflicting data types.</li>
          <li>!= is used to compare two values and check if they are not equal.</li>
          <li>!== is used to compare two values and check if they are not equal and not the same data type.</li>
          <li>var is used to declare a variable. Function-scoped, unless declared outside of function.</li>
          <li>let is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned. This is block-scoped.</li>
          <li>const is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned. This is block-scoped.</li>
          <li>var is less common due to bugginess and the advent of let and const.</li>
          <li>Array: A single variable that holds a group of related data. Arrays are not limited to one type of data. var studentInfo = [Bryan, 28, true];</li>
          <li>console.log() is a method, and within the parenthesis will be an argument.</li>
          <li>Function: A set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Functions must be called in order to execute.</li>
          <li>For Loops can be used in situations where you need to repeatedly execute a block of code a specific number of times or until a condition is met.</li>
